# REST API with ExpressJS and MySQL

Welcome to the REST API with ExpressJS and MySQL repository! This repository contains the source code for a RESTful API built with Express.js and MySQL database.

## Description

The REST API with ExpressJS and MySQL is a backend solution for building scalable and robust web applications. It provides endpoints for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources, allowing developers to interact with data stored in a MySQL database through HTTP requests.

## Features

- **CRUD Operations:** Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on resources such as users, products, or any other entity.
- **Middleware Support:** Easily integrate middleware functions for authentication, authorization, validation, logging, etc.
- **Error Handling:** Handle errors gracefully with customizable error messages and status codes.
- **Security:** Implement security measures such as input validation, parameterized queries, and authentication to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
- **Scalability:** Build scalable APIs capable of handling a large number of requests using Express.js's asynchronous, event-driven architecture.
- **Documentation:** Document API endpoints and usage for better understanding and collaboration.
